# Udacity-CVND-Project3-Landmark-Detection-and-Tracking-Graph-SLAM
## Objective
Implement SLAM, a robust method for tracking an object over time and mapping out its surrounding environment using elements of probability, motion models, linear algerbra.


## Project Instructions

The project will be broken up into three Python notebooks; the first two are for exploration of provided code, and a review of SLAM architectures, **only Notebook 3 and the `robot_class.py` file will be graded**:

**Notebook 1** : Robot Moving and Sensing

**Notebook 2** : Omega and Xi, Constraints

**Notebook 3** : Landmark Detection and Tracking

You can find these notebooks in the Udacity workspace that appears in the concept titled **Project: Landmark Detection & Tracking**. This workspace provides a Jupyter notebook server directly in your browser.

You can also choose to complete this project in your own local repository, and you can find all of the project files in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/P3_Implement_SLAM). Note that while you are _allowed_ to complete this project on your local computer, you are strongly encouraged to complete the project from the workspace.

## Evaluation

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the Landmark Detection & Tracking project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1428/view). Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.

## Zip file submission

If you are submitting this project from a workspace or as a zip file, it is recommended that you follow the instructions in the final workspace notebook to compress your project files and make sure your submission is not too large. You are _only_ graded on Notebook 3, and the file `robot_class.py`.
